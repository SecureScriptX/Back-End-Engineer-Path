- The command line is a text interface for the computer’s operating system. 
- A filesystem organizes a computer’s files and directories into a tree structure. It starts with the root directory.       Each parent directory can contain more child directories and files.

- From the command line, you can navigate through files and folders on your computer:
  - `pwd` outputs the name of the current working directory.
  - `ls` lists all files and directories in the working directory.
  - `cd` switches you into the directory you specify.
  - `mkdir` creates a new directory in the working directory.
  - `touch` creates a new file inside the working directory.
  -  use helper commands to make navigation easier:
  - `clear` clears the terminal.
  - `tab` autocompletes the name of a file or directory.
  - `↑` and `↓` allow you to cycle through previous commands.
