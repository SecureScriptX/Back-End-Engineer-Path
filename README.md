   - Build a Node.js console app that generates random messages each time a user runs the program and version your project with Git/GitHub

2. **Personal Budgeting, Part I**
   - Use Node.js and Express to build an API for an app that mimics the practice of envelope budgeting

3. **Personal Budgeting, Part II**
   - Add a PostgreSQL database layer to the budget app and implement software architecture principles like KISS and YAGNI
