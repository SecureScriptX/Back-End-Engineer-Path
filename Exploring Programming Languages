## Introduction

When I began my coding journey, one question frequently crossed my mind: "What exactly is a programming language?"

In simple terms, programming involves providing a set of instructions to a computer for execution.The complexity of the instructions corresponds to the complexity of the outcome.

Programming languages serve as tools to write instructions for computers. Computers "think" in binary, represented by strings of 1s and 0s. Programming languages enable us to translate these binary instructions into something comprehensible for humans. A programming language comprises symbols that act as a bridge, facilitating the translation of human thoughts into computer-understandable instructions.

## Low-Level vs. High-Level Programming Languages

Programming languages fall into two classifications: **low-level and high-level**.

- **Low-level programming languages** are closer to machine code or binary, but the advantage of low-level languages lies in their speed and precise control over computer functions.

- **High-level programming languages** are closer to human communication. They use words similar to everyday language, making them easier to program in compared to low-level languages.

## Most Popular Programming Languages

Let's delve into some of the most popular programming languages and their applications, according to GitHub's PYPL Index, which ranks languages based on Google tutorial searches.
